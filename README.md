# Updates

- Remember to not only update your repo but use the cmd `eas update --branch main
` to update the EAS deployment
- If you'd like to use EAS Build with EAS Update, run eas build:configure
- Run eas build when you are ready to create your first build.
- Once the build is completed, run eas submit to upload the app to app stores.
